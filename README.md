IPL Economic & Social Governance Framework

Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and proposed governance framework for the Indian Premier League (IPL), focusing on balancing its significant economic contributions with social and public health responsibilities. The project examines IPL’s advertising ecosystem, the societal impacts of high-risk product promotions, and develops ethical, data-driven policies to promote responsible sports sponsorship and advertising practices.

Objectives

- Analyze IPL's economic impact, including revenue generation, employment, and growth.

- Evaluate the social and health implications of IPL advertising strategies, especially concerning high-risk products like betting apps, pan masala, and alcohol.

- Identify gaps in current regulatory frameworks and propose a responsible advertising policy.

- Develop an integrated governance framework emphasizing ethical standards, public health safeguards, and sustainable growth.

Why This Project Is Needed

While IPL drives massive economic growth and fosters national pride, its current advertising ecosystem raises critical concerns about gambling addiction, tobacco health risks, and youth exposure to risky behaviors. There is an urgent need for a balanced approach that safeguards public health without compromising the league’s revenue potential. This project aims to provide actionable insights and policy recommendations to promote responsible sports marketing.
